# atelier

`atelier` is my personal neovim config.

Intended to be used as an input to a flake, or by (eventually) running the following via nix:

```sh
nix run github:NekoDrone/nvim
```

### Thanks to

- [comfysage](https://github.com/comfysage) and [isabelroses](https://github.com/isabelroses) for letting me reference their dotfiles and nvim configs, and for making [gift-wrap](https://github.com/tgirlcloud/gift-wrap)
